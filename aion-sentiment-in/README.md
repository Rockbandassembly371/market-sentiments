**AION Sentiment Analysis** is an open-source Python package for analyzing sentiment and emotions in financial news text. Part of the [AION open-source ecosystem](https://github.com/aion), it provides pre-trained models and emotion analysis tools for financial NLP applications.

## ⚠️ DEVELOPER NOTICE - Model Under Retraining

**Status:** The model is currently being retrained with corrected sentiment labels.

**Issue:** A data labeling inconsistency was discovered in the original training data. The model is being retrained using VADER-corrected labels on our 957K Indian financial news corpus.

**Expected Resolution:** A corrected v2 model will be released soon.

## What Makes AION-Sentiment-IN Different

AION-Sentiment-IN is **NOT** just another FinBERT re-skin. The value additions beyond "Indian news context" are:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **India‑specific fine‑tuning** | Trained on proprietary Indian financial news corpus (not US FinBERT) |
| **Sentiment labels** | Corrected via VADER lexicon (not relying on broken SHAM/UNIFIED_ROUTER labels) |
| **Emotion mapping** | 8‑dimension emotion scores (anger, fear, joy, sadness, trust, disgust, surprise, anticipation) using NRC lexicon |
| **Confidence bands** | Planned integration with India VIX regimes to weight sentiment confidence |
| **Sector mapping** | Separate package (`aion-sectormap`) maps NSE/BSE tickers to sectors (already working) |
| **News impact** | RAG pipeline linking headlines to historical price moves (future) |

**Together, these make AION‑Sentiment‑IN unique** – it's not just a re‑labelled FinBERT.

## Overview

AION-Sentiment-IN provides:

- **Sentiment Classification**: Classify financial news as negative, neutral, or positive
- **Emotion Analysis**: Fine-grained emotion detection across 8 categories (anger, fear, joy, sadness, trust, disgust, surprise, anticipation)
- **HuggingFace Integration**: Load models directly from HuggingFace Hub
- **Local Fallback**: Support for offline development with local model paths
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient processing of multiple texts
- **Type-Safe API**: Comprehensive type hints and error handling

## Installation

### From PyPI (Recommended)

```bash
pip install aion-sentiment-in
```

### From Source (Development)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aion/aion-sentiment-in.git
cd aion-sentiment-in
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- PyTorch 2.0+
- Transformers 4.35+

## Quick Start

```python
from aion_sentiment import AIONSentimentIN, EmotionAnalyzer

# Initialize sentiment model (loads from HuggingFace by default)
model = AIONSentimentIN()

# Predict sentiment
result = model.predict("AAPL stock soars on earnings beat")
print(f"Sentiment: {result['sentiment_label']}")  # positive
print(f"Confidence: {result['confidence']:.2%}")  # 95.23%
print(f"Emotions: {result['emotion_scores']}")    # {'joy': 0.8, ...}

# Initialize emotion analyzer
analyzer = EmotionAnalyzer()
emotion_result = analyzer.analyze("Market crashes amid uncertainty")
print(f"Dominant emotion: {emotion_result.dominant_emotion}")  # fear
```

## API Reference

### AIONSentimentIN

The main class for sentiment prediction.

#### Constructor

```python
AIONSentimentIN(
    model_name_or_path: str = "aion-analytics/aion-sentiment-in-v1",
    local_path: Optional[str] = None
)
```

**Parameters:**
- `model_name_or_path` (str): HuggingFace model identifier or local path. Defaults to the official AION model.
- `local_path` (Optional[str]): Local path for model files. Used for development/offline mode.

#### Methods

##### `predict(text: str) -> dict`

Predict sentiment for a single text.

**Parameters:**
- `text` (str): Input text to analyze.

**Returns:**
```python
{
    "sentiment_label": "positive",  # negative, neutral, or positive
    "confidence": 0.95,             # confidence score (0.0-1.0)
    "emotion_scores": {...},        # emotion scores for 8 categories
    "all_scores": {                 # raw scores for all classes
        "negative": 0.02,
        "neutral": 0.03,
        "positive": 0.95
    }
}
```

**Example:**
```python
model = AIONSentimentIN()
result = model.predict("Stock market reaches new highs")
print(result["sentiment_label"])  # positive
```

##### `predict_batch(texts: list) -> list`

Predict sentiment for multiple texts.

**Parameters:**
- `texts` (list): List of input texts.

**Returns:**
- List of prediction dictionaries (same structure as `predict()`).

**Example:**
```python
texts = ["Stock rises", "Market falls", "Fed announces rates"]
results = model.predict_batch(texts)
for text, result in zip(texts, results):
    print(f"{text}: {result['sentiment_label']}")
```

---

### EmotionAnalyzer

Class for fine-grained emotion analysis using the NRC Emotion Lexicon.

#### Constructor

```python
EmotionAnalyzer(lexicon: Optional[dict] = None)
```

**Parameters:**
- `lexicon` (Optional[dict]): Pre-loaded lexicon. Auto-downloads if not provided.

#### Methods

##### `analyze(text: str) -> EmotionResult`

Analyze emotions in text.

**Parameters:**
- `text` (str): Input text to analyze.

**Returns:**
- `EmotionResult` object with:
  - `text`: Original input
  - `emotions`: Dict of emotion scores
  - `dominant_emotion`: Highest-scoring emotion
  - `dominant_score`: Score of dominant emotion
  - `word_count`: Number of words analyzed
  - `matched_words`: Words matched in lexicon

**Example:**
```python
analyzer = EmotionAnalyzer()
result = analyzer.analyze("Market crashes dramatically")
print(f"Dominant: {result.dominant_emotion}")  # fear
print(f"Scores: {result.emotions}")            # {'fear': 0.8, ...}
```

##### `analyze_batch(texts: list) -> list`

Analyze emotions for multiple texts.

**Parameters:**
- `texts` (list): List of input texts.

**Returns:**
- List of `EmotionResult` objects.
